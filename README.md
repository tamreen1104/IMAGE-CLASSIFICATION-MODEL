# Description
The primary goal of this task is to design, train, and evaluate a CNN that can accurately classify images into different categories. You are required to:

Select or obtain an image dataset suitable for classification (for example, handwritten digits, fashion products, animals, or objects).

Build a CNN architecture using either TensorFlow (with Keras API) or PyTorch.

Train the model on the training dataset and evaluate its performance on the test dataset.

Report performance metrics and observations based on your results.

This task will help you gain practical experience in deep learning, specifically in designing architectures suited for image data and understanding how CNN layers work together to identify patterns in images.

Instructions
Dataset selection: Choose a public dataset that is appropriate for image classification. Some popular options include MNIST (handwritten digits), CIFAR-10 (10 classes of small color images), Fashion-MNIST (fashion products), or any dataset available on platforms like Kaggle. Make sure the dataset is labeled and divided into training and test sets.

Model design: You need to define the CNN architecture. A typical CNN contains:

Convolutional layers that apply filters to extract features such as edges, textures, or shapes.

Activation functions (like ReLU) to introduce non-linearity.

Pooling layers (such as max pooling) to reduce spatial dimensions and computation.

Fully connected layers that perform classification based on the features extracted by convolutional layers.

Output layer with softmax (for multi-class classification) or sigmoid (for binary classification).

Model training: Compile your model with a suitable loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy for multi-class tasks), an optimizer (e.g., Adam or SGD), and performance metrics (e.g., accuracy). Train the model using your training data and validate it using a portion of your data or a separate test set.

Evaluation: After training, evaluate your modelâ€™s performance on the test dataset. Report key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and display a confusion matrix if possible. Optionally, plot training and validation loss/accuracy curves to analyze overfitting or underfitting.

Deliverable
You are expected to submit:

A Jupyter Notebook or equivalent Python script that contains:

Data loading, preprocessing, and augmentation (if applied).

Model architecture code.

Training and evaluation code.

Performance metrics and plots.

Your code should be well-commented and easy to follow.

Store your work in a GitHub repository with organized folders for code, datasets (if allowed), and results.

Learning Outcomes
Through this task, you will:

Learn how CNNs work and why they are effective for image classification.

Understand the role of convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers.

Gain hands-on experience with deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Improve your skills in evaluating and interpreting model performance.
